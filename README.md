**🎯 User Needs: How the New Presto UI Better Meets User Expectations**

The redesigned Presto interface isn't just visually improved—it’s functionally superior. It incorporates essential UX laws and psychological cues that help users feel more in control, less overwhelmed, and more likely to succeed in completing their AI-driven tasks. Here's how:

👋 1. Personalized Welcome & Familiar Flow
(Jakob’s Law)
 By greeting users with “Welcome Back, Nitin,” the UI taps into Jakob’s Law, which suggests that users prefer interfaces that feel familiar based on their previous experiences. The friendly tone and clear call-to-action (“Ready to create your new AI task?”) mirror the logic of platforms users already love, minimizing the learning curve.

🔍 2. Unified Search and Task Creation Field
(Law of Uniform Connectedness)
 The single input bar for typing, speaking, or uploading tasks is a perfect example of Uniform Connectedness—grouping related actions (input + submit) inside one element to indicate that they serve the same purpose. It reduces confusion and makes the user journey more linear and intuitive.

🎛️ 3. Sidebar Navigation with Chunking
(Miller’s Law - Chunking)
 The sidebar smartly categorizes features into digestible segments—Search, Home, Assistant, Actions, Teams, etc. This aligns with Miller’s Law, which says users can only hold 5–9 pieces of information in their working memory. By chunking related actions into meaningful groups, your UI avoids cognitive overload and keeps navigation quick and effortless.

✨ 4. Minimalist Design that Feels Easier to Use
(Aesthetic-Usability Effect)
 The soft gradients, clean layout, and iconography create a modern, calming interface that users perceive as easier to use—thanks to the Aesthetic-Usability Effect. Even if there’s complex functionality underneath, the polished look builds user trust and reduces perceived difficulty.

📦 5. Smart Suggestions & Contextual Nudges
These dynamic suggestions (e.g., “Want me to analyze your data?”) provide a personalized onboarding experience and help reduce the anxiety of not knowing where to start. It respects both novice and experienced users by offering guidance without being intrusive.

🧠 6. Quick Visibility of Tools & Status
The redesigned bottom-left section displays AI credit usage and workspace details clearly, without clutter. This kind of predictable placement and visibility ensures that users can access essential status updates without breaking flow—supporting both utility and simplicity.

⚡ 7. Call-to-Action That Matches Intent
The prominent “+ New Task” button—visually set apart with a vibrant color and icon—is not just eye-catching but context-aware. It leverages Visual Hierarchy and Fitts's Law, making the primary action both noticeable and easy to click.

The redesign embodies user-centered thinking, pairing beautiful aesthetics with intuitive usability. Each design choice supports user goals: from reduced friction in task creation to smoother onboarding and better navigation. By applying proven UX principles naturally, the new interface provides:
✅ Faster decision-making
✅ Lower cognitive load
✅ A more confident and engaging user experience



**🎨 Design Choices: Rational, Purposeful & User-Centric**
The redesigned UI for Presto is driven by intentional design thinking—balancing aesthetics with usability to deliver an interface that feels intuitive, elegant, and efficient. Here's the rationale behind each major design decision:

✅ Layout: Structured for Focus and Flow
The screen is divided using a two-column layout, following the natural F-pattern of how users scan web pages. This helps prioritize content without overwhelming the user.


The left sidebar provides persistent navigation, making key features like Assistant, Teams, and Marketplace easily accessible at all times.


The central area is dedicated to user interaction (task creation), enhancing task-oriented workflows and reducing cognitive load—aligned with Hick’s Law (fewer choices = faster decision-making).


Clear visual hierarchy, ample spacing, and alignment ensure high readability and scannability across the page.


✍️ Typography: Clean, Modern, and Readable
The primary typeface is modern and sans-serif, maintaining a professional tone while ensuring legibility on both large and small screens.


Font weights are strategically used to create contrast—like the bold welcome message and lighter task suggestions—leveraging typographic hierarchy to guide the user’s eye naturally.



🌈 Color Palette: Calming Yet Interactive
The base UI uses a soft white and cool gradient background, giving it a light and breathable feel.


Brand-accent colors like Presto blue and vibrant purple are used to highlight CTAs (like "+ New Task") and interactive elements. This is in line with color affordance principles—making it clear what can be clicked or tapped.


The color contrast is accessible, meeting WCAG standards to support users with visual impairments.



🖼️ Imagery & Iconography: Minimal Yet Expressive
Icons are line-based and clean, enhancing visual clarity without cluttering the interface.


Instead of heavy imagery, the interface uses simple glyphs and symbolic visuals, focusing on task utility over decoration—supporting the minimalistic theme.


The logo is consistently placed and sized, reinforcing brand recall.



🎛️ Interaction Design: Intuitive and Effortless
Micro-interactions such as hover effects, button feedback, and dropdown expansions follow Jakob’s Law—users expect your platform to behave like other tools they’re familiar with.


The voice, image, and text task input options are grouped together, following Miller’s Law (chunking) to reduce memory strain and improve input discoverability.


The floating tip bar and task suggestions improve engagement while being non-intrusive.




**♿ Accessibility Considerations for Presto Assistant**

Designing with inclusivity in mind was a key part of the new Presto UI. The goal is to ensure that all users, regardless of physical or cognitive ability, can navigate and use the platform with ease. Here’s how the new design addresses accessibility:

✅ 1. Clean Layout with Clear Visual Hierarchy
The new interface uses generous white space, large headings, and consistent iconography to help users quickly understand where they are and what actions are available. This benefits users with cognitive disabilities or attention disorders by reducing clutter and visual overload.

🌈 2. High Contrast & Readable Typography
We’ve ensured good contrast between background colors and text (e.g., the blue welcome text against a light background), which helps users with low vision or color blindness. The font used is legible and sans-serif, which makes reading easier for everyone, including those with dyslexia.

🖱️ 3. Keyboard Navigation & Shortcuts
The sidebar includes keyboard shortcut hints like ctrl/cmd + K for search, promoting better accessibility for power users and those who rely on keyboard navigation instead of a mouse.

📱 4. Touch-Friendly & Scalable Design
The layout components such as buttons, dropdowns, and task selectors have ample touch targets, making the UI friendly for users with limited motor control or those accessing the interface via tablet devices.

🧭 5. Descriptive Icons & Labels
All icons are accompanied by clear text labels (e.g., "Actions", "Notifications", "Reports"), reducing ambiguity for screen readers and improving navigation for users with cognitive impairments.

🔊 6. Assistive Technology Compatibility
The input section features a microphone button, supporting voice input. This not only speeds up interaction but also helps users with motor impairments or dyslexia who may prefer speaking to typing.

🔁 7. Feedback & Error Prevention
Subtle system feedback (like credit usage notifications or tips about long chats) helps users stay informed and avoid frustration. Clear, contextual tips are especially important for users with memory or comprehension challenges.

🔍 Future Improvements
Incorporating ARIA roles and live regions for enhanced screen reader support.


Allowing users to switch to a high-contrast theme or enable dyslexia-friendly fonts.


Adding accessibility settings in the profile section for full customization.

**🔁 Iteration Plan: Improving the Presto Assistant Experience**

To ensure that the redesign of the Presto Assistant page truly enhances the user experience, we’ll follow a structured and feedback-driven iteration plan. The approach is divided into key phases to test, learn, and improve based on both qualitative and quantitative user insights.

🚀 Phase 1: Initial Launch (Beta Rollout)
We’ll begin by rolling out the redesigned interface to a small segment of users (around 10–15%) to monitor how they interact with it in real time.
What we’ll do:
Run A/B testing between the old and new interface.


Add in-app feedback tools (like emoji-based ratings or short comment boxes).


Conduct user interviews, especially targeting new users.


Use heatmaps and session recordings to observe navigation behavior.


Key metrics to track:
Engagement: Time spent on the page, number of tasks created.


Onboarding Success: Percentage of new users who create a task within 2 minutes.


Satisfaction: CSAT (Customer Satisfaction) scores, NPS (Net Promoter Score) after a few sessions.


Adoption: Return rate within 3 days, use of suggested templates.



🔄 Phase 2: First Iteration (2–3 Weeks Post Launch)
Based on the feedback and data collected from the beta rollout, we’ll make our first set of refinements.
Focus Areas:
Simplify tooltips and onboarding content for better clarity.


Introduce personalization options like naming the assistant or saving default templates.


Tweak layout hierarchy based on the most-used features.


Ongoing testing:
Continue A/B testing different variations of key UI elements (e.g., welcome message vs. task templates).


Monitor task creation funnel for drop-off points.


Use updated heatmaps to analyze feature engagement.



✨ Phase 3: Second Iteration (After 1 Month)
With more usage data and evolving feedback, we’ll shift focus to polishing and deeper personalization.
What we’ll enhance:
Add a “pinned tasks” section for frequent users.


Introduce dark mode and layout customization.


Optimize the assistant’s responsiveness and behavior during long task sessions.


New metrics to evaluate:
New User Activation Rate: % of users who complete a task within 5 minutes.
